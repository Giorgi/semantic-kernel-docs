# Deploy Prompt flows with Semantic Kernel to Azure

[!INCLUDE [pat_large.md](../../../includes/pat_large.md)]

Once you've created a Prompt flow, you can deploy it to Azure ML. This has several benefits:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Access to an endpoint that can be called from anywhere
> * Active evaluations of your Prompt flow while running in production
> * Ability to share your Prompt flow with others (including non-developers)

If you would like to deploy your Prompt flow to another service, you can refer to the [open source deployment guide](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/how-to-guides/deploy-a-flow/index.html) for Prompt flow.
