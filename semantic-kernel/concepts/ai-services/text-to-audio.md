# Text-to-audio (Experimental)

Text-to-audio is the process of generating audio from a text prompt. Today's chat completion models currently do not support text-to-audio. To allow your AI agents to verbalize its responses, you can post-process any of the messages generated by the model into audio.

> [!NOTE] There are several different types of text-to-audio models, including those that generate speech, music, and more. In future versions of Semantic Kernel, we plan on making this interface more specific to the type of audio you want to generate to make it easier to request the right model through dependency injection.


To add a text-to-audio service, you can use the following code to add it to the kernel's inner service provider.

# [Azure OpenAI](#tab/AzureOpenAI)

# [OpenAI](#tab/OpenAI)

# [Hugging Face](#tab/HuggingFace)

---

If you're working directly with a service provider, you can also use the following methods.

# [Azure OpenAI](#tab/AzureOpenAI)

# [OpenAI](#tab/OpenAI)

# [Hugging Face](#tab/HuggingFace)

---

Lastly, you can create instances of the service directly so that you can either add them to a kernel later or use them directly in your code without injecting them into the kernel.

# [Azure OpenAI](#tab/AzureOpenAI)

# [OpenAI](#tab/OpenAI)

# [Hugging Face](#tab/HuggingFace)
