### Task automation

These functions are used to perform actions on behalf of a user. These are helpful when you want to automate business processes with AI.
Examples include the following.

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Email | Allows an AI to send and receive emails on behalf of a user. |
| Microsoft 365 | Allows an AI to use Microsoft 365 applications, such as Microsoft Word so that it can edit documents on behalf of a user. |
| Home automation | Allows an AI to control smart home devices like lights, thermostats, and security cameras. |
| Inventory | Allows an AI to update inventory levels based on sales or new shipments. |

When developing plugins for task automation, itâ€™s important to ensure that you have the necessary safeguards in place to ensure the AI cannot perform actions without user consent.
