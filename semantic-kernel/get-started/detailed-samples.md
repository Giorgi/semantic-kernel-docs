# Deep dive into Semantic Kernel

If you want to dive into deeper into Semantic Kernel and learn how to use more advanced functionality not explicitly covered in our Learn documentation, we recommend that you check out our concepts samples that individually demonstrate how to use specific features within the SDK.

   :::column span="3":::
        Each of the SDKs (Python, C#, and Java) have their own set of samples that walk through the SDK. Each sample is modelled as a test case within our main repo, so you're always guaranteed that the sample will work with the latest nightly version of the SDK.
