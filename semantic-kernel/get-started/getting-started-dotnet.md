# Start learning how to use Semantic Kernel


In just a few steps, you can start running  the getting started guides for Semantic Kernel in either C# or Python. After completing the guides, you'll know how to...
- Configure your local machine to run Semantic Kernel
- Run AI prompts from the kernel
- Make AI prompts dynamic with variables
- Create a simple AI agent
- Automatically combine functions together with planners
- Store and retrieve memory with embeddings


If you are an experienced developer, you can skip the guides and directly access the packages from the Nuget feed or PyPI.
