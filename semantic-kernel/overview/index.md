# Introduction to Semantic Kernel

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
        Semantic Kernel is an open-source SDK that lets you easily build agents that call your existing code. As a highly extensible framework, it can be used with models from OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face, and more! By combining your existing C#, Python, and Java code with these models, you can build agents that answer questions and automate processes.

# A framework beyond chat

:::row:::

        Today's AI models easily generate messages and images. While this is helpful for chat apps, it’s not enough to build robust solutions that fully automate business processes. To do so, you need a framework that takes a prompt to elicit a response from the models and uses it to call existing code to do something truly productive. Semantic Kernel does just that. Allowing you to easily describe your existing code to AI models so they can request that they be called. Afterwards, Semantic Kernel does the heavy lifting of translating the model's response into a call to your code.

# Designed for modular extensibility

You’ll be equipped to build future-proof solutions that evolve with technological advancements. Easily add your existing code through plugins to maximize your investment and innovation potential. Flexibly integrating AI services through a set of connectors that make it easy to add memories and AI models. 

Orchestrate nearly any of your existing code without being locked into a specific AI model. For example, if you built a bunch of plugins for OpenAI's ChatGPT, you could use Semantic Kernel to orchestrate them with models from other providers like Azure or Hugging Face.

        Use different components of Semantic Kernel separately or together. For example, if you just need an abstraction over OpenAI and Azure OpenAI services, you could use the SDK to run handcrafted prompts. But the real power of Semantic Kernel comes from combining these pieces together. Using your own plugins, prompts, planners, AI models, and memories to create bespoke solutions to meet your exact needs.

# Get started

Now that you know what Semantic Kernel is, try it out using the quick start guide. Within minutes you’ll create prompts and chain them with out-of-the-box plugins and native code. Then, you’ll give your apps memories with embeddings and summon even more power from external APIs.
