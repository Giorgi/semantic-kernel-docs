# Use Case - HR Copilot

Many companies offer online chat support to customers to assist with concerns and customer questions. In particular, many companies use AI Agents and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to support chats with customers who experience issues with their product, warranty requests, issues with shipping and delivery for example.  

This external chat for support is costly as agents must find the correct answer to customer issues. Contoso Company wants to automate this support proceed to save time and money by creating AI Agents focused on support who can quickly retrieve information, relay it to the customer in the support chat and resolve their issues.
